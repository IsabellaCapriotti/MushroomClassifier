# MushroomClassifier
Implements a logistic regression model to classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible using records from [The Audobon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom). 

The actual model on its own can be found in the Jupyter notebook. 

There is also a small game to demonstrate what the model can do. It first trains the model, and then uses it to make predictions on a series of generated mushrooms 
that the player will encounter. The goal of the game is to survive as long as you can by deciding which mushrooms are edible. The trained model will then check your answers.
